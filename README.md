## Features

- Reviewer filter bar
    - Shows all reviewers on the current page who haven't requested changes on, or approved a, PR
    - Clicking on an avatar will filter the current page to only show work pending for that person
- Reviewer avatars on individual PRs
    - Shows status of review (pending, requested changes, approved)
        - Green full circle border: Reviewer has approved PR
        - Yellow dashed circle border: Reviewer has requested changes on PR
        - No border: Reviewer hasn't looked at PR, or has only commented
    - Displays "None" when no reviewers are assigned
    - Supports "Team" reviewers
- Deployment status pills
    - List the environments a PR has been or is currently deployed to
        - Green: The PR is currently deployed to this environment
        - Yellow pulsing: The PR is being deployed to this environment
        - Gray: The PR was deployed to this environment at some point, but has been superseded by a different branch
    - Hovering over a pill will show additional info depending on context, e.g. deployment at, superseded on, etc
